# College Hub - Improvements & Fixes Summary

## üêõ Logical Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigation Bug in LoginScreen
- **Issue**: After successful login, app navigated to "Home" instead of "Main" tab navigator
- **Fix**: Updated navigation to go to "Main" which contains the proper tab structure
- **File**: `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`
